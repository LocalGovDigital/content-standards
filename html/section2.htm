                        A digital form means an online form, or similar function that provides quick and
                        easy access to council services online. The customer should not have to read through
                        guidance before they use the form, though guidance or terms and conditions should
                        be made easily available, and the customer may have to indicate they have read them
                        before submitting a request online.

                            2.2.1 Content guidance</h3>
                        Most information on council websites relates to a service the customer does not
                        have to pay for at the point of delivery. The most important thing to remember when
                        writing content relating to this is that you are not selling or promoting the service.
                        In many cases the customer has no choice but to use this service and because of
                        this, the page should be kept as simple as possible, sticking to what the customer
                        needs to know.

                        Some councils offer services on top of those provided for free. Where this is the
                        case the benefits of purchasing this service can be explained. As with 2.1 however,
                        the customer should not have to read through guidance before they use the service,
                        but guidance or terms and conditions should be made easily available, and the customer
                        may have to indicate they have read them before submitting a request online.

                            2.4.1 Content guidance</h3>
                        Promotional content will often relate to specific services or information offered
                        by the council. It will sometimes contain quotes from officers or elected members.
                        The content should always link to that specific service or contact details for officers
                        or members.

                        Similar to promotional content, individual content is written to highlight the work
                        or activities of one individual. Whilst this content should conform to guidance
                        on plain English, links, etc it is possible for it to form a corporate style. It
                        should always be stated that the views expressed are those of the individual, and
                        not necessarily those of the organisation that has published them.

                            2.6.1 Content guidance</h3>
                        For statutory reasons, sometimes councils need to publish pages written in legal
                        or technical language. Where this is the case jargon and acronyms should be explained
                        by the use of Tooltips and Popovers, where possible. There should also be a companion
                        page explaining the content in terms the public will understand, or a page with
                        a glossary of terms, which can be linked to from the Popovers.

                            2.7.1 Content guidance</h3>
                        Similar to promotional articles, but more functional in style this content should
                        promptly describe the facts of the situation, linking to any relevant information.
                        It should describe the problem, how it might affect the reader, what the council
                        is doing to resolve or mitigate against it, what the reader can do to resolve or
                        mitigate against it and how the situation might change in the near future. Unlike
                        promotional content like news or press releases, this content should be removed
                        as soon as the situation changes, which may be a matter of hours, as it may be viewed
                        out of context and give readers a false representation of the situation.
