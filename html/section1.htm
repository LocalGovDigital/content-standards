                        Unless you need to do so formally, refer to your service, organisation, or the council
                        in general, as ‘we’ and ‘us’. Refer to the readers as ‘you’ where appropriate so
                        they feel we’re talking to them personally, but avoid using ’our’ and ’your’ which
                        can create confusion.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Remember the council is referred to as a singular term. For example: “council x
                        is launching a new service”, and not “council x are launching a new service”.

                        Unless legally required to do so, avoid using council or professional jargon. If
                        you must use an abbreviation or acronym, then follow these principles:<br />
                        &nbsp;<ul>
                            <li>Well-known abbreviations and acronyms (e.g. BBC, UK) are acceptable</li>
                            <li>If possible, include a Popover to explain what an acronym, abbreviation or piece
                                of jargon means - always spell out acronyms or abbreviations in full the first time
                                you use them</li>
                            <li>Don’t use an abbreviation or acronym if you’re only referring to something once</li>
                            <li>Use a shorter form of the phrase instead of an acronym or abbreviation if possible</li>
                            <li>Don’t use full stops in abbreviations – BBC not B.B.C.</li>
                            <li>Avoid referring to forms or documents by numbers (e.g. ‘Form 21B’) – give them a
                                ‘friendly name’ based on their title and what they are used for; only include a
                                reference number if it’s widely understood as shorthand by both customers and the
                                council.</li>

                        Bullet points make text easier to read. Here’s how to use them:<br />
                        &nbsp;<ul>
                            <li>Always use a ‘lead-in’ sentence before starting the list off – as we’ve done above</li>
                            <li>Bullets should always make sense running on from the lead-in sentence</li>
                            <li>Don’t use full stops within bullet points – where possible start another bullet
                                point or use commas, dashes or semicolons to expand on something</li>
                            <li>Don’t put ‘or’, ‘and’ after the bullets</li>
                            <li>Don’t end bullets with a full-stop</li>
                        </ul>

                    <div id="contact" class="contentsection">
                        <h2>
                            1.4 Contact information</h2>
                        Frequently published physical addresses, members, senior officers, services and
                        teams should have their own page on your site. This is: So that the customer can
                        find out more information, such as opening hours or a location map where applicable
                        To avoid having to keep many instances of the same information up to date You can
                        find more about this in <a href="section2.htm#locationorservice">Section 2.8</a>.
                        <h3>
                            1.4.1 People and teams</h3>
                        Unless talking about a member or senior officer, avoid using individual names or
                        other personal contact details. Refer instead to the contact details of their team
                        or service. This is to make sure that any correspondence is answered as quickly
                        as possible.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        An exception to this is in promotional material such as news items, when a quote
                        from a named officer may be used. When you do refer to an individual, use their
                        post title. For example: “Chief Executive Officer Jane Smith”. After that, refer
                        to them by name only. For example: “Jane Smith”
                        <h3>
                            1.4.2 Links and email addresses</h3>
                        Links to other pages should always be in the text, though you can include them in
                        a collection of related links somewhere else on the page too. Never use phrases
                        like ’click here‘ on their own, as a screen reader would just miss this text out.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Always make the link text flow within the sentence on the page but describe what
                        you’re linking to, for example: Our human resources policy was first introduced
                        in 2008 and is periodically reviewed to ensure that it’s up-to-date.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Write email addresses in full, in lowercase and as active links. Don’t include any
                        other words as part of the link. Once you’ve linked a document, page or resource
                        once using a phrase in the text, don’t repeat this each time the same phrase is
                        used afterwards.
                        <h3>
                            1.4.3 Telephone numbers</h3>
                        Use ‘Telephone:’ or ‘Mobile:’ not ‘Mob:’ or ‘Tel:’. Use spaces in the number between
                        the city dialling code and local exchange.

                        <h2>
                            1.5 Ampersands</h2>
                        For accessibility reasons, avoid using the ampersand (&). Avoid using any special
                        characters in titles.

                        <h2>
                            1.6 Capital letters</h2>
                        Don’t use block capitals - it’s hard to read and customers interpret this as shouting!
                        Keep everything in lower case unless it’s a proper noun. For instance: “[add council
                        name here] Council” is capitalised as it refers to the formal name of the organisation.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        When referring to ’the council’ in a general way, don’t capitalise the ‘C’. It is
                        not a proper noun, and also implies the council is a stuffy and formal organisation
                        rather than simply the collective term for accessible, friendly people providing
                        services to our customers!

                            <li>Monday to Friday, 9am to 5pm</li>
                            <li>10 November to 21 December</li>
                            <li>10am to 11am (not 10–11am)</li>
                            <li>When referring to ‘today’ (for instance in a news article) make sure you include
                                the date as well. For example:</li>
                            <li>“The minister announced today (14 June, 2012) that…”</li>
                            <li>Only use the endings st, nd, rd and th when referring to centuries, anniversaries,
                                or positions. For example: He lived in the 19th century</li>
                            <li>For financial years, sports seasons and school years write 2012/13 not 2012-13,
                                2012-3, 2012/3 or 2012-2013. For example: Funding is available for 2012/13</li>

                            1.8 ‘e’ as a prefix</h2>
                        Where the prefix ‘e’ refers to electronic, it should always be lower case with a
                        hyphen. For example:<br />
                        &nbsp;<ul>
                            <li>e-business</li>

                            <li>e-learning</li>
                            <li>e-procurement</li>
                        </ul>
                        The only exception to this is Email. At the beginning of a sentence, capitalise
                        the first letter of the word that follows the e, rather than the e itself. For example:<br />
                        &nbsp;<ul>
                            <li>e-Business</li>
                            <li>e-Government</li>
                            <li>e-Learning</li>
                            <li>e-Procurement</li>
                        </ul>
                        Again, there is only one exception - ‘Email’ at the start of a sentence must be
                        capitalised.

                        but not £75.00. Write numbers less than £1million, in full rather than as a fraction,
                        eg: £700,000 rather than £0.7million. Write out ‘pence’ in full, eg: ‘calls will
                        cost 4 pence per minute from a landline’.

                            Use images only when they add useful additional meaning or information. A generic
                            picture of a computer keyboard when talking about online services is unlikely to
                            add anything to the page, or to the message you’re trying to get across. However,
                            using an attractive, high-definition picture of a new state-of-the-art school in
                            your area which provides online services is useful – this gives a strong impression
                            of the council’s commitment to online services, and to providing high-quality facilities,
                            and will probably support the content on the page.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            Think about the appearance of the page as a whole, and the context you’re placing
                            an image into. Pictures and images should be consistent, useful and clear, and not
                            clash with the overall look-and-feel of the your organisation’s website.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            Don’t simply use images sourced from search engines or taken from other websites–
                            there are intellectual property and copyright considerations. Make sure that you
                            own the image, or you have explicit permission to use it.

                                1.12.1 Alt Text</h3>
                            Alt text is the term for descriptive text used as an alternative to an image, for
                            people who use screen readers. It is different to any caption you display alongside
                            the image on the web page as it is not displayed for most customers automatically.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            Think of alt text as text which sits ‘behind’ the image. If the image isn’t shown,
                            the alt text needs to describe usefully what is there. Alt text isn’t necessary
                            for all images. For example, you don’t need to apply alt text for a logo on the
                            page – this usually adds nothing to the understanding of the content. However, if
                            there is a picture of a new school building, put in an appropriate description,
                            for instance: “Photograph of Councillor Jane Smith in front of the new Willink School
                            computer facility in Burghfield Common”. Google will also rank lower any pages with
                            images that don't have good alt text; another reason to make sure it’s included.

                                1.13.1 Page titles</h3>
                            Keep it short: eight words will appear in search, so think about which eight words
                            are going to best convey your information. Make it snappy: Where possible avoid
                            stop words like ‘of’, ‘in’, ‘at’, ‘for’, ‘and’ – search engines simply ignore these
                            terms. If you use them, make sure they’re not taking up the space of a keyword (but
                            equally don’t remove at the expense of helping the title making sense!). Front-load
                            keywords:
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            You can use ‘if’ if really necessary but be very careful, front-loaded statements
                            are faster to read. For example: “Licences for Firearms” or “Firearms Licences”
                            Is better than “Applying for and Obtaining a Licence for a Firearm” Does it stand
                            up on its own? Your page may be seen out of context from related pages. Make sure
                            the title makes sense on its own. Don’t rely on ‘implied context’.

                                1.13.2 Meta-description points</h3>
                            Some content management systems allow authors to edit metadata associated with the
                            page. If this is the case:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Don’t just repeat the title, meta-descriptions should cover the scope of the content
                                    item and sell it to the intended audience</li>
                                <li>Include popular keywords found with keyword tools</li>
                                <li>Think laterally – customers may use search terms or keywords that don’t correspond
                                    to internal jargon or references</li>
                                <li>Optimal length for meta-descriptions is around 150 characters</li>
                                <li>Use dashes and commas but don’t use full stops</li>
